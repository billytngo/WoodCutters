This game is built on top of Cocos2d-html5 framework to demonstrate 2 Parallel Scheduling algorithms in non-preemptive and preemptive modes. Like solving Sodoku puzzle, players will cut the logs and place them to the grid within constraints set up by those 2 scheduling algorithms. You have to solve this puzzle to clear the stage. A higher level will appear with more logs to add up the difficulty. Are you ready yet?
It's not only working for my Final Master Project at California State Polytechnic - Pomona, but it is also fun and challenging puzzle game for players.
The project also contains the original cocos2d-html5-v2.2.3.zip for reference.
